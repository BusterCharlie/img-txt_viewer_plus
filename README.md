Place images and txt files in the same folder, with the same name.

So 01.png and 01.txt and so on. The names need to be same same between pairs, but there's no special formatting needed.

.png and .jpg supported.

Pressing CTRL+S will save the current text file.

Holding ALT and pressing Left/Right arrow keys will move to the next or previous img/txt pair.

The bulk of this code was created with ChatGPT, and as such there's still a ton I want, but lack the knowledge.
