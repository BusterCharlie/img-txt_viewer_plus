# üí° Tips and Features

- Hotkeys:
  - `ALT+Left/Right`: Quickly move between img-txt pairs.
  - `Del`: Send the current pair to a local trash folder.
  - `ALT`: Cycle through auto-suggestions.
  - `TAB`: Insert the highlighted suggestion.
  - `CTRL+S`: Save the current text file.
  - `CTRL+Z` / `CTRL+Y`: Undo/Redo.

- Tips:
  - Highlight duplicates by selecting text.
  - Right-click the directory button to copy the path.
  - Middle-click the directory button to open the folder.
  - Right-click or Middle-click the displayed image to open its folder.
  - Get autocomplete suggestions while you type using Danbooru tags.
  - Enable `Big Comma Mode` for more visual separation between captions.
  - Blank text files can be created for images without any matching files when loading a directory.

- Text Tools:
  - Search and Replace: Edit all text files at once.
  - Prefix Text Files: Insert text at the START of all text files.
  - Append Text Files: Insert text at the END of all text files.
