# üìù Usage

- Prepare Your Files:
  - Put each image and its matching text file in the same folder.
  - If you choose to include a text pair for an image, ensure they are located in the same folder and have identical names.
  - For example: `01.png` and `01.txt`, `02.jpg` and `02.txt`...
  - Supported image types: `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.jfif` `.jpg_large` `.webp` `.bmp`
