Place images and txt files in the same folder, with the same name.

So 01.png and 01.txt and so on. The names need to be same same between pairs, but there's no special formatting needed.

.png and .jpg supported.

__________
CTRL + Z (sort of) works.

CTRL + S will save the current text file.

ALT + Left/Right arrow keys will move to the next or previous img/txt pair.

If the auto-save box is checked, text will be saved when moving to the next or previous img/txt pair.

__________

This only uses pillow and tkinter, so if you have Python installed, you're good to go!

__________

v1.1 changes:

Fixed trailing space/new line when saving
