# üìú Version History

- [v1.75 changes:](https://github.com/Nenotriple/img-txt_viewer/releases/tag/v1.75)
  - New:
    - New tool: `Batch Token Delete` This tool allows you to see a list of all tokens in the selected folder and delete them easily.
      - This tool can be used "standalone" without img-txt_viewer. Simply double-click the .py file and select a directory.
      - NOTE: v1.0 of Batch Token Delete currently relies on a cleanup function within img-txt_viewer to properly clean text files.
    - New tool: `Cleanup Text` This fixes common typos in all text files within a chosen folder, such as double commas or spaces and missing spaces after commas.
    - New option: `Suggestion Style` Here, you can select from four options. The old style is still there, plus a new default style.
    - New option: `Suggestion Alignment` Here you can select between "Left Aligned", and "Centered". The default is now: Left Aligned.
    - Changes: `Prefix` and `Append`: These tools now insert commas and spaces where appropriate. Prefix=`token, ` Append=`, token`
    - UI Tweaks.

<br>

  - Fixed:
    - `cleanup_text` now handles situations like `, ,` *(and repeating)*
    - Further improvements for suggested text insertion and cursor positioning. *(This is a tricky one to nail down)*
    - Pressing ‚ÄúAlt‚Äù to cycle a suggestion, then typing, unintentionally cycles the suggestion again.
    - When moving to the next/prev pair using the alt+Arrow hotkeys: The suggestion index would progress by +/-1.
    - The suggestion label now updates after setting the suggestion quantity.
    - Issue where `Big Comma Mode` wouldn't enable when using some features.
    - Error handling is added to check for a directory before running certain tools.
