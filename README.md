# üìù Usage

- Prepare Your Files:
  - If you choose to include a text pair for an image, ensure they share the same basenames.
  - For example: `01.png` and `01.txt`, `02.jpg` and `02.txt`, etc.
  - Supported image types: `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.jfif` `.jpg_large` `.webp` `.bmp` `.gif`

Images and text files can be loaded from different folder paths. Expand the section below to learn more.

<details>
  <summary>Selecting an alternate text path:</summary>

By default, text files are loaded from the chosen path. To load text files from a different path, first select a directory as usual, then right-click the `Browse...` button and select `Set Text File Path`. An indicator to the left of the Directory entry will turn blue when a different path is chosen, and hovering the mouse over the indicator will display the selected text path.

 - Example folder structures:


```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.png
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.txt
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.jpg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.txt
```
*(Images and text files in same folder)*

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.jpg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ captions/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01.txt
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 02.txt
```
*(Images and text files in separate folder)*

<details>
  <summary>Click here to view release notes!</summary>

  - New:
    - New autocomplete matching modes: `Match Whole String`, and `Match Last Word` [732120e](https://github.com/Nenotriple/img-txt_viewer/commit/732120e61dbe0758f8f00c4852edf3f435b32c29)
      - `Match Whole String`, This option works exactly as before. All characters in the selected tag are considered for matching.
      - `Match Last Word`, This option will only match (and replace) the last word typed. This allows you to use autocomplete with natural sentences. You can type using an underscore as a space to join words together.
    - New option for image grid view: `Auto-Close`, Unchecking this option allows you to keep the image grid open after making a selection. [67593f4](https://github.com/Nenotriple/img-txt_viewer/commit/67593f4876daf0cdbc6170dbb7c8820b99d8636d)
    - New Tool: `Rename img-txt pairs`, Use this to clean-up the filenames of your dataset without converting the image types. [8f24a7e](https://github.com/Nenotriple/img-txt_viewer/commit/8f24a7e41a4fb4770fb5bd06d9dd2337b31c6270)
